## Development Environment:
- **Programming Language:** Dart (Flutter)
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Flutter, PyMuPDF, Text-to-Speech Library, DALL-E 3 API, Video Editing Library
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Android Studio/Xcode for Flutter development

## Project Overview:

The Chapter Analysis and Storytelling App aim to provide an immersive experience by analyzing chapters from PDFs, generating expressive storytelling videos through text-to-speech synthesis, and enhancing visual elements using the DALL-E 3 API for image creationâ€”all built with Flutter for a cross-platform mobile application.

## Detailed Goals:

### Primary Goals:
1. **Week 1 (10-15 Feb): Project Setup and Core Features with Flutter**
   - Set up the Flutter development environment.
   - Integrate PyMuPDF for PDF parsing.
   - Develop a mobile-friendly user interface for PDF upload using Flutter widgets.
   - Integrate a Dart-compatible text-to-speech library.
   - Fine-tune speech synthesis within the Flutter app.
   - Conduct initial testing.

2. **Week 2 (16-21 Feb): API Integration and Video Creation with Flutter**
   - Obtain access to the DALL-E 3 API.
   - Develop the integration for image generation compatible with Dart/Flutter.
   - Mid-Evaluation: Evaluate progress and make adjustments.
   - Choose a Dart/Flutter-compatible video editing library/framework.
   - Combine images and synthesized speech into storytelling videos.
   - Implement sentence pronunciation and handle different punctuations.

3. **Week 3 (22-26 Feb): UI Refinement, Testing, and Finalization with Flutter**
   - Develop the user-friendly mobile app interface using Flutter.
   - Add options for users to alter speed and pitch within the Flutter app.
   - Thorough testing and finalization for cross-platform compatibility.
   - Address any last-minute issues or improvements within the Flutter app.
   - Final Evaluation: Review the entire project.
